	* (devnode.c): Rename devnode_populate() to create_block_devnodes() for
	better understanding,
	Use mknod() system call instead of forking system(),
	Disable SCSI scanning as the only driver (st.ko) to-be-found-and-probed is now
	built-in to the kernel image,
	* (module.c): Alias parsing is completely dropped,
	* (main.c): Disable waiting for USB storages by default, give
	--wait-for-storage for explicitly waiting for them.
	* (Makefile): Use -O2 as reducing code size doesn't matter much,
	Compile with dietlibc which results in faster execution time.

	* (main.c): Probe only DRM modules if --drm is given,
	* (utility.c): Rewrite sys_value to not use static variables,
	* (utility.c): Add priority field for prioritizing the probing of DRM
	modules over other ones,
	* (module.c): Use device_class to detect if the module is for VGA or not,
	* (module.c): Don't try to re-modprobe already loaded modules for PCI
	devices.

	* Replace tabs by spaces,
	* Update copyrights,
	* Change function signature typesetting,
	* (utility.c): Add a debug function to print some messages,
	* (main.c, module.c): Use debug to give information about sleeps
