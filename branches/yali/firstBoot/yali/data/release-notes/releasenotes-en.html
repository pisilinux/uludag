<h2>2. Basic features</h2>

This section describes the Pardus 2007.3 features.

<h3>2.1 Updated network manager</h3>

Network manager can detect your own wireless profiles and automatically
switch to one of them. It also gives information via a popup from 
taskbar which makes network manager more intuitive and user friendly.

Package manager is more polished now. Many bugs in bug tracker have been
fixed.

procedure. User also can decide whether to login to desktop automatically
or not. Last but not least, it includes definitions for state-of-the-art
hard disks, in order to ease installation process.

Moreover, YALI can understand whether a disk is bootable or not, and decide 
which disk to install Pardus on. This feature is first introduced
in Pardus distribution.
