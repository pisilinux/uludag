Following steps will be useful to test Yalı in an arbitrary order :)

 - Check translations
 - Check Release Notes and License files
 - Check different keyboard layouts and note the selected one to test after install
    - Test it in tty and X
 - Set Date and Time, select a timezone and note it to test after install
    - Compare selected Timezone in /usr/share/zoneinfo/TIMEZONE with /etc/localtime
 - Add two users; one of with root privileges, one of without
    - Delete one and edit the other one and update it

        - After the installation finished
            Type as root

    - Try to use not acceptable chars for inputs
    - Try to use wrong passwords in password inputs
 - Add users then select one of them for autologin.
 - Do each of these options;
    - Select automatic partitioning to test resizing
        - Use more than 7 Gb disk partition which formatted with a resizable filesystem (ext3, ext4, ntfs)
        - Check both filesystem after installation, old one and new one
    - Select Erase all partitions to format all partitions
    - Use Manual partitioning and create some partitions with all supported filesystems
        - Delete each one and add again
        - Delete all
        - Revert all changes
        - Resize some of them
        - Plug a new usb disk and click refresh disk
        - Try to create same partitions type with different partitions
        - Try to give different filesystems to already applied partitions
    - First select  automatic partitioning,  then turn back and select manual partitioning and do the manual partitioning testcases.
    - Select manual partitioning then try to create different partitions with different filesystems, then try to turn back.
        - Does a message box appear on the screen in order to alert that the changes made will be removed.
