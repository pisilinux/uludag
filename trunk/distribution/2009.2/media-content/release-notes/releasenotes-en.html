<h3>1.1. What is Pardus</h3>

Pardus is a Linux distribution developed as a product of the Pardus Project, by National Research Institute of Electronics and Cryptology (UEKAE), which is under the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) and by volunteered contributors. It is named after the Latin (and scientific) name for the Anatolian leopard, Panthera pardus tulliana.
<br><br>

Pardus consists of a Linux based operating system, opensource applications and related data files necessary for desktop and server environments, aiming to provide users stable, reliable, easy to use and feature rich computer experience.

<h3>1.2. How Can I Use Pardus</h3>

Pardus comes with two flavours, Kurulan (which installs Pardus to your computer) or Çalışan (live media, running on the media only, slower but does not install on your computer) and can be started from a CD / DVD / External storage (USB stick for example) or can be installed to internal harddisk depending on your preference.
<br><br>

Çalışan (live) image and Kurulan (installation) images contain support for English and Turkish languages, and can fit on one CD. International image is a multilanguage image (including Turkish) contains language packages, some applications and artwork that are not included in Kurulan image. International image is about 1GB in size, and can be written on a DVD or harddisk like media like a USB stick.

<h2>2. What is new ?</h2>
<h3>2.1. Updates in Pardus Technologies</h3>

Core Pardus technologies are updated to new versions, including many bugfixes, optimizations and new features.
<br><br>

Pardus manager family has been refactored and optimized for new KDE 4.4 / Qt 4.6 environments. Pardus KDE tools, Network Plasmoid for easy network profile switching and Service Plasmoid for easy service management are available in our repositories. These plasmoids can be placed either on the desktop, or any of the panels on the desktop for easier access.
<br><br>

A new KDE tool <strong>plasma-runner-pisi</strong> has been added to provide easy package installation in KDE environment. Under KDE environment, when you start up krunner (default by pressing ALT-F2) and write a command that is not available on the running system but provided by a package in Pardus repositories, an entry to install the necessary package will appear. Simply selecting the entry will automatically install the required package.
<br><br>

<strong>Package Manager</strong> and <strong>PiSi</strong> have been optimized for better performance and improved stability. PiSi interface has been refactored for easier use. Package Manager went through heavy refactoring and is now using <strong>Pardus Desktop Services</strong>, which allows the GUI to run on desktop environments other than KDE 4 without the necessity of any KDE library. Among performance enhancements on the GUI, Package Manager now supports update types. Type of the updates are shown next to packages and users can select group of updates (security for example) easily from the Package Manager GUI.
<br><br>
