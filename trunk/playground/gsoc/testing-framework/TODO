-	Support for passing packages for custom parsing through the command line
	
	This will involve replacing the current 'optparse' module with 'argparse',
	which is included in the Python 2.7 standard library. Since we are initially
	targeting Python 2.6+ users, we decided to go ahead with 'optparse' only.

	* Planned
	
	./package-testing.py -f test_file.xml -p package-1 package-2 package-3 ... package-n
  
	* Current

	./package-testing.py -f test_file.xml -p package_file		
	
	where package_file is a file with the contents:
      
	package-1
	package-2	
	package-3
	.
	.
	.
	package-n
