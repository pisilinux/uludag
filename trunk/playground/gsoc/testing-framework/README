=== Pardus Testing Framework ===

Written from scratch as a 'Google Summer of Code 2010' project


Requirements:
-------------
Pardus Linux
Python 2.6+
lxml 2.2+


Usage:
------
The input file (specified by the '-f' option) is mandatory.
Usage: package-testing.py [options] arguments

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file=FILE  specify the input XML test case file for testing
                        (REQUIRED)
  -p FILE, --packages=FILE
                        specify the input file for custom package processing
  -o FILE, --out=FILE   specify the output file to print the list of packages
                        in the input XML


Options Details:
----------------

1]. -f : XML Testcase Input File

The '-f' option is used to specify the input test case XML file. This option is REQUIRED.


2]. -p : Custom Package Processing

The '-p' option is used to specify an input file which has a list of the specific packages
that you want to parse against the test case input file (specified by the '-f' option).

For example, you want to run the tests only on the packages 'P1' and 'P2', the tests for 
which are present in the input test case file. To create a custom package input file, 
create a new file and enter the list of packages, separated by a newline, as shown:

P1
P2

Then, pass the '-p' option to the framework:

./package-testing.py -f <test case-XML-file> -p <package-input-file>

Note that you can only pass a file with the list of packages as an argument to '-p' and 
not a list of packages. We will fix this in the future.


3]. -o : Output Package List

The '-o' option is used to print a list of all the packages present in the test case input
file specified by the '-f' switch. 

./package-testing.py -f <test case-XML-file> -o <output-package-file>

This will output the list of all the packages in the test case file to the file specified.

*NOTE*: You can either use the '-p' or the '-o' option, but not both.
The framework will throw up an error, but you have been warned!


Bugs:
-----

There is no bug tracker associated as of now, however you can always report bugs and
request for new features to the author at: sukhbir [dot] in [at] gmail [dot] com
 
Use the framework to do good and help others!
