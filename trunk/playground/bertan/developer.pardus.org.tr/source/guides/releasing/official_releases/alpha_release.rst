Alpha Release
-------------

:Author: Semen Cirit
:Last Modified Date: |today|
:Version: 0.1

The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin software
testing.

Feature acceptence deadline is held during this phase and the `requested features`_
from users and developers are reported to `Pardus Bugzilla`_ before this deadline.

The requested features are reviewed and also prioritized during this period
and no more features are added to this list. The features are also started to
develop by developers.

During this phase Alpha release brockers should also be fixed.

For the packages, `urgent package list`_ is created periodically and put as text
file under the related release' `package source repository`_ `devel branch`_.
These packages are updated and merged to new `package source repository`_ at given
period and time.

As we can see during alpha phase rapid changes occur and so the software can be
unstable and could cause crashes or data loss.
