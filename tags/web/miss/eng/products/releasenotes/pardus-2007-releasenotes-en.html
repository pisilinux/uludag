<li>800 MHz Intel or AMD processor (suggested to be at least 1200 MHz)</li>
<li>4 GB free hard disk space</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Improvements in this version</h2>

Pardus 2007 arise with a development period of more than 6 months. This version includes the improvements made upon the feedbacks coming from end users, which are listed below.

<h3>4.1 Pardus firewall</h3>

Pardus firewall designed to be easy to use software which aims to guard against the attacks that would come outside the system. It continuously run on the system and protects your computer against the attacks. With Pardus firewall, you can disable connections to the machine, close a specific port or monitor current connections.

<h3>4.2 Improved package management system</h3>

PISI now uses LZMA algorithm, resulting in a 30% speed improvement, thus leaving more space for applications. With this improvement, PISI packages and the softwares downloaded by end users are decreased in size and it is possible to distribute more software with in Pardus 2007.

<h3>4.3 New software management interface</h3>

PISI package management interface substituted with its easy to use successor (package manager). This new software provides to install, uninstall and update the programs easily and effectively.

<h3>4.4 Improvements in installer system YALI</h3>

Some of the bugs have been fixed up in YALI and it is configured to work with COMAR and PISI infrastructure. Furthermore, YALI interface justified and make up with new colors.

<h3>4.5 New and improved Pardus startup system</h3>

The processes between the kernel starts to operate with the login screen appeared to the user are managed by the startup system. This includes mounting the file system, discovering the hardware information and installing their drivers, basic network configuration and starting up system services. Also it is responsible for stopping the services, unmounting the file systems with caring their consistency while shutting down the computer.

<br>
<br>

The source of Pardus startup system is rewritten from scratch caused of the startup system in Pardus 1.0 that was too slow to operate and unsatisfied to discover the hardware.

The new system comes up with "mudur" (which means "manager" in English) that is a basic startup script written with Python and "muavin" (which means "assistant" in English) that is responsible to look for hardware modules and install them respectively which is also written in Python. Scripts of system services are managed by Comar thus provides the advantage of parallel processing and easy usage. With this improvement,

<ul>
<li>A significant decrease provided at the booting up and shutting down durations. </li>
<li>Pardus 2007 has become much more flexible and easy to maintain distribution with the power of Python. </li>
<li>Services are designed and programmed with giving capability of being managed by command prompt or controlled easily with in TASMA. </li>
</ul>

<h3>4.6 More hardware identification</h3>

The new hardware identification system peculiar to Pardus allows handlingnearly the complete hardware types on the market and works in harmony with them. Since it minimizes the manual identification of the hardware,  no requisites remain to the end user to set up drivers. Pardus can identify and configure the hardware automatically while booting up the system.
 
<br>
<br>

The hardware identification system named as Muavin prevents to load unneeded modules resulting in a significant saving on the memory. Furthermore, instead of using hotplug system which is an old technology, the newer and more flexible technology named as udev is used for dynamic device naming.

<h3>4.7 Fixed up more than 1200 bugs</h3>

More than 1200 bug reports sent to the bug tracking system of Pardus, examined and fixed up carefully by developers after release 1.0 thus providing a strong, more stable and targeted to be used by end users.

Support for USB ADSL modem that comes together with this kernel, provides possibility to identify more USB ADSL modems than the old release. Furthermore, the boot problem is solved caused by APIC/ACPI with the old machines. The  kernel boot up duration is decreased 3 seconds with the patch for identifying the IDE hard disks.

<br>
<br>

Some of the supported new hardwares:

<ul>
<li>New SATA devices</li>
<li>USB ADSL modem support</li>
<li>Enhanced wireless network devices support</li>
<li>Support for more cameras, scanners and printers</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.9 New icon sets</h3>
