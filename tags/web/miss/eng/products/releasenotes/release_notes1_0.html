<p>
Welcome to Pardus, an easy to install and use system, with many enhancements
to desktop usability, compatibility and security. With Pardus, you can 
connect to Internet, read your e-mails, securily communicate with
your friends and exploit your computer's multimedia capability by listening
to music and watching movies. We kindly invite you to
<a href=http://www.uludag.org.tr/eng>http://www.uludag.org.tr/eng</a>
to explore new Pardus opportunities. 
</p>

<p>
<h2>Basic system requirements</h2>
While Pardus will work on any modest hardware, we recommend that you 
have 512 Mb of RAM and 1200 Mhz CPU. While these are two very basic 
conditions to let Pardus work in an effective way, the minimum requirements can be set 
as follows:

<p>
<div class="box">
256 Mb of RAM (<b>512 Mb recommended</b>) <br>
800 Mhz Intel or AMD CPU (<b>at least 1200 MHz recommended</b>) <br>
</div>

<p>

We also recommend broadband internet connection (i.e. ethernet, wireless etc.) 
to reach Pardus services and be able to download many other productivity 
software.
<p>

A sound card will automatically be detected and used after you install Pardus. 
You will need to configure your printer with a straightforward process 
in your first login.

<p>
<h2>What's new in 1.0?</h2>

 The project developers have been working hard on
Pardus for your desktop pleasure. Below, you can find the most notable
and interesting new ideas and features of Pardus 1.0.
<p>

<h3>PiSi: New packaging system</h3>

Pardus comes with its own packaging system, PiSi, which
has its own characteristics and advantages over other package managers. 
With PiSi, developers can enjoy packaging new software in an efficient way. 
End users will get comfortable with PiSi's fast and hassle-free software
installation interface. With a few clicks, you can easily search for utilities
you need and install it on your disk. 



<h3>Newest Linux kernel</h3>

 
Pardus comes with 2.6.14 kernel, and includes additional patches,
improvements and bug fixes to the stock kernel. Therefore, you will 
benefit from new hardware drivers, improved memory management system
and performance enhancements.



<h3>OpenOffice.org 2.0 with new templates and cliparts</h3>

 
For your office software needs, Pardus includes an amazing
software, OpenOffice.org which can open and save Microsoft Office 
files. OpenOffice.org's new version, 2.0, has been used widely
on both Windows and Linux. You can use OpenOffice.org 2.0's 
word processor, spreadsheet, presentation and database software
without breaking your compatibility with other office files. 
We have added more clip-arts, templates and extensions to this 
version for your pleasure.


<h3>Installation is a snap with YALI</h3>


YALI (<b>Y</b>et <b>A</b>nother <b>L</b>inux <b>I</b>nstaller) has been
developed and thoroughly tested in Pardus laboratories, where our distribution
is born. New users will find it easy to use: with a few mouse clicks, you can
start enjoying Pardus. Not only it can install system in an effective way,
one can easily distringush YALI's speed improvements. We believe that YALI is 
one of the fastest Linux installer on earth. 




<h3>The K desktop environment 3.5</h3>
 KDE is the most renowned desktop environment with
all-in-one applications and utilities. We have analysed and decided the
most comprehensive, yet easy to use KDE components for your desktop
experinence. Fore more information, please note down KDE's web site:
<a href=http://www.kde.org>http://www.kde.org</a>



<h3>ÇOMAR, the configuration manager</h3>

 
Pardus comes with its own configuration backend, called ÇOMAR, which
is a new technology developed in Pardus laboratories. ÇOMAR configures
your ethernet card, video card, monitor and other peripherals in such
a way that you can benefit most from your hardware. With ÇOMAR, you 
won't need extra configuration by hand.


<h3>Your new collaboration suite: Kontact</h3>
 With Kontact, you can read your e-mails, maintain
a rich addressbook of your friends, use its built in reminder for your
birthdays, anniversaries and meetings, easily connect to your friend's
blogs and organize your valuable time with personal information manager. 
KDE calendar utility (Korganizer) can also organize your calender's
synchronization with your colleagues, through a server (Kolab). This 
way, you can implement a collaboration system in your organization, 
benefitting...
