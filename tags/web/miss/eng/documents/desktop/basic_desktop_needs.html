<!--TOC section Definitions-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc1">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</H2><!--SEC END -->

From our point of view, an operating system that meets the basic desktop
needs can serve the user with an easy-to-use, configurable and customizable
desktop. <BR>
<BR>
Desktop environment is a graphical user interface in which there is
data flow and communication between similar interfaces and processes
and which can perform drag-and-drop, copy-and-paste features between
applications. The desktop environment consists of the menu, the panel
and the desktop itself -the place where the icons and shortcuts for
files, directories, application launchers and environmental devices
exist.<BR>
<BR>
While meeting the basic desktop needs, its desirable for the user
not to need the rights of the root user who is the most authorized
user in the system.<BR>
<BR>
Another necessity is to meet the basic desktop needs with graphical
interfaces. The hardware should be configured automatically; in the
cases where user should intervene, the work should be performed with
graphical interfaces alone. In a similar sense, the actions to install/remove/update
the software should be done via graphical interfaces. The user shouldn't
be forced to work with the console (command line) screen for any of
their needs.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to those mentioned above, all the applications in Pardus
should be using Turkish and UTF-8 as a default language, provided
that Pardus is installed Turkish.<BR>
<BR>
As being a GNU/Linux distribution, the software on Pardus should meet
any Linux user's needs. For this reason, base system (Unix) tools
should appear on the software list, as well.<BR>
<BR>
Along with these definitions, the basic desktop system should be meeting
the conditions and supporting the items below.<BR>
<BR>

<!--TOC section A desktop suitable for Turkish and Turkey-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc4">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A desktop suitable for Turkish and Turkey</H2><!--SEC END -->

Regarding all the interfaces interacting with the user, Turkish support
is a must for Pardus. Those interfaces can be classified below.
<UL><LI>
Application interfaces
<LI>Menus
<LI>Help files
<LI>System and application messages
</UL>
Besides, font types which are suitable for a Turkish interface should
exist in the system and they should be used as default.<BR>
<BR>
For the distribution software, its imperative that the choises which
are suitable for Turkey are made and data such as calendar information
is added.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section Information messages-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc5">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Information messages</H2><!--SEC END -->

Messages to inform the user should be free of technical details. Ideally,
instead of pointing out the problems in a technical manner, messages
should contribute to the solution by means of assistant programs.<BR>
