<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Abstract: </B>
With thousands of packages to maintain, most important part of
any distribution is indeed its package management system. PiSi is
the package manager of Pardus, written from scratch in Python. By
writing another package manager, our purpose was not to reinvent the
wheel but to create a new kind of wheel that takes distinctive
ideas from existing ones with also easy integration and maintenance
in mind.<BR><BR>
You may download and try Pardus 2007 stable release to see PiSi in
action from <a href="ftp://ftp.pardus.org.tr/pub/pardus/kurulan/2007">ftp://ftp.pardus.org.tr/pub/pardus/kurulan/2007</a>

<!--TOC section Introduction-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc1">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</H2><!--SEC END -->

PiSi (Packages Installed Successfully, as intended) is the package
manager of Pardus. It is a tool used to build, install,
upgrade or remove software packages of Pardus Linux distribution.<BR>
<BR>
Before deciding to write a new package system, we considered using
the existing ones. Three years ago when the Pardus project was started,
RPM had many problems. [<A HREF="#key-68">1</A>] One of the bigger problems
was also not having one upstream to work with. Today, it is still
a work in progress.[<A HREF="#key-69">2</A>]<BR>
<BR>
As for DPKG, despite the fact that it had a much better state than
RPM and having a single upstream, we had found its architecture hard
to work on. Package preparation is cumbersome and complicated. Also
some decisions like ``interactive package installation'' wasn't
the ideas we would support for our distribution. The installation
of any package should just be done without confusing the user with
configuration internals of any package. The user should only choose
and install the package. Configuration should not be a job for a package
system. Moreover, as it was stated in a discussion made years ago,
its code had become brittle.[<A HREF="#key-70">3</A>]<BR>
<BR>
Also as they seem to be different in their nature, mechanism behind
them and the ways are the same that were not satisfying us. We wanted
something different. <BR>
<BR>
The package manager in our mind should ease the package creation task
for the package developers and should pave the way for working with
binary packages. For the former, Gentoo's portage had some good ideas.
So at the end we decided to design PiSi with all the advantages of
the ones over each other and write it in Python. As all other
components of the distribution were going to be written in Python,
it would also be much easier to integrate to those parts and prototyping
phase would be much much faster. <BR>
<BR>
After having a prototype to work with, the development of PiSi went
parallel with the development of the packages of the distribution.
After a 6 months of work, with 10 people, we had created 600 packages
and so the first stable release of Pardus. Now after a year from our
first stable release, with 25 developers, we have a total of 1223
packages in stable branch of Pardus 2007 and 698 packages in our
contrib repository. <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section Why PiSi?-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc2">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why PiSi?</H2><!--SEC END -->

To answer that question, we first need to define what a package is
and what needs to be done for a package to be build, deployed and
maintained by a distribution. For a package system, every phase of
a package's existence from its maintainer's hands to the distribution
users' machines have problems that need to be solved. There exists
many package systems that solve these problems in different ways.
What makes PiSi great lies in the simplicity and the efficiency of
the solutions it provides.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection What is a Package?-->

<H3>What is a Package?</H3><!--SEC END -->

There are two kinds of packages for PiSi: source and binary. <BR>
<BR>
A binary package is a container that consists of a collection of files
and meta data. The meta data holds detailed information about the
package, like homepage, version and runtime dependencies of the contained
software, packager info, etc. The collection of files may be executables,
libraries or other data files that are all parts of the contained
software. PiSi binary packages have ''.pisi'' extensions and are
actually zip archives. The files other than the meta data are compressed
with another compression algorithm within the zip archive that is
detailed later. Binary packages exist in PiSi binary repositories.<BR>
<BR>
A source package minimally consists of an actions.py file that contains
the setup, build and install instructions to create a binary package
and a pspec.xml file that contains the other necessary informations,
like build and runtime dependencies, conflicts, url or path of the
source archive, etc. Source packages exist in PiSi source repositories.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Simple by Design-->

<H3>Simple by Design</H3><!--SEC END -->

The most obvious part of PiSi is its simplicity. From its svn like
console interface pisi-cli to its package building mechanism, it is
very easy to grasp the inner workings and use effectively. It is so simple that when the first PiSi
source code was revealed with some example source packages, it only
took twenty-minutes for someone to contribute a new package to Pardus.
And there were no documentation about the build system whatsoever.
Xml based source packaging system is so intuitive and easy to
grasp that it almost needs no documentation. <BR>
<BR>
Actually this was intentionally made that way. When you look at the
current package managers, you can see that the variety of the tools
for managing and the various package building helper tools, create
an unnecessarily complicated system.<BR>
<BR>
The first complication comes from the different tools that combined
make the desired package management possible. The so called native
package managers (DPKG, RPM, etc.) does the house keeping jobs and
above them there exists many other wrapper tools (apt, dselect, urpmi,
yum, aptrpm, etc.) for mainly handling the dependency resolution,
package selection and installation issues.<BR>
<BR>
But the main complication and difficulty comes from the various build
helper tools, ad-hoc source specification formats and build
scripts. The learning curve is steep for new developers.<BR>
<BR>
PiSi architecture is quite different from traditional designs. Every
functionality, related to package management like installing, building,
dependency solving, fetching, validating, repository management is
in the core of PiSi. On the other hand, package configuration is clearly
separated from package management system and is delegated to COMAR.
The configuration system is not limited with preremove or postinstall
scripts; it is a much more advanced system that makes all the installed
packages to be configured in a unique way by using the same COMAR
API. A package may provide a configuration service script to be used
as a configuration interface for itself. Configuration of packages
can be done remotely or locally.<BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, build scripts of packages are shell scripts. We think
shell is ideal for simple tasks, like batch run of a series of
commands with maybe some conditionals but nothing more. Shell
scripting is awkward. It needs many other additional 
helper tools with their own syntax and usage. Moreover, debugging and
maintenance costs are high.<BR>
<BR>
When it comes to a complex task like building a package, you need
conditional operations, string manipulations, iteration over series
of data, and many other operations where you can all get from higher
scripting languages also with additional advantages. For those reasons
we have chosen Python.<BR>
<BR>
Python is the choice of Pardus in all of the distribution's core components
for its simplicity, flexibility and easing the maintenance advantages.
YALI (Yet Another Linux Installer), the simple, fast and the pretty
installer of Pardus [<A HREF="#key-79">4</A>]; Package Manager (the graphical
frontend of PiSi) [<A HREF="#key-80">5</A>]; Pardusman, the automatic Live or
Install Pardus distribution CD/DVD creator that only needs for the
packages to be selected [<A HREF="#key-81">6</A>]; Buildfarm, the software that
creates the binary repositories from the corresponding source repositories
[<A HREF="#key-82">7</A>]; all use PiSi internally. A complicated system like
buildfarm is written in a 1-2 weeks of time with Python and PiSi api.<BR>

<!--TOC subsection Build System of PiSi-->

<H3>Build System of PiSi</H3><!--SEC END -->

<!--TOC subsubsection Overview-->

<H4>Overview</H4><!--SEC END -->

PiSi build system consists of a meta information file called pspec.xml
and the actual build script file called actions.py. These are the
main files to build a binary package. There can be other optional
files like patches and COMAR scripts. <BR>
<BR>
Following is a sample source package from the current stable branch
of Pardus:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
openssh
<BR>
&nbsp;|__&nbsp;comar
<BR>
&nbsp;|&nbsp;|__&nbsp;service.py
<BR>
&nbsp;|
<BR>
&nbsp;|__&nbsp;files
<BR>
&nbsp;|&nbsp;|__&nbsp;openssh-4.3_p1-chroot.patch
<BR>
&nbsp;|&nbsp;|__&nbsp;scp-resume.sh
<BR>
&nbsp;|&nbsp;|__&nbsp;sshd.pam
<BR>
&nbsp;|
<BR>
&nbsp;|__&nbsp;actions.py
<BR>
&nbsp;|
<BR>
&nbsp;|__&nbsp;pspec.xml<BR>
</TT></DL></DIV>
pspec.xml and actions.py files are in the root directory of the package.
files directory is optional and may contain the patches or additional
files to the package. Another optional directory, comar, contains
COMAR scripts for integrating package with the rest of the system;
all to be registered to COMAR daemon. COMAR needs an article of its
own so we will not focus on the COMAR related parts.<BR>
<BR>
Following is the content of a sample binary package from the current
stable branch of Pardus:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
Archive:&nbsp;joe-3.5-2-2.pisi<BR>
Length&nbsp;Date&nbsp;Time&nbsp;Name<BR>

--------&nbsp;-------&nbsp;276844&nbsp;3&nbsp;files
</TT></DL></DIV>
Automatically generated metadata.xml and files.xml files are in the
root directory of the binary package. metadata.xml file holds the
meta data information related to binary package that are extracted
from pspec.xml file. files.xml file holds detailed information about
all the files that are contained in the install.tar.lzma like hash,
type, size, user, group and mode informations of the files.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsubsection Build Scripts-->

<H4>Build Scripts</H4><!--SEC END -->

PiSi build scripts are divided into three phases: setup, build and
install. setup is the configuration phase prior to build. Build phase
is the actual compilation phase. And the install phase is where the
build output is installed to the destination system. Depending to
the package, setup and build phases may be optional.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the build automation software systems [<A HREF="#key-87">8</A>] that
are used by the source archives of the packages, roughly need these
steps to install the software but they differ from each other. So
what PiSi does is to provide an underlying and unified framework for
the known build systems and make the packagers' lives easier. This
framework is called ActionsAPI and is included with PiSi package as
an independent module. The actions.py scripts use this module to build
packages.<BR>
<BR>
Following is the actions.py script of joe package as an example:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;autotools.install()</TT></DL></DIV>
<!--TOC subsubsection Package Specifications-->

<H4>Package Specifications</H4><!--SEC END -->

Build scripts are not enough to create a package. There are some other
necessary informations used in the build phase and also some meta
data that is needed to be placed in the output package. We decided
to separate the meta data from the build scripts and placed them into
a file called pspec.xml. Pspec.xml holds build related informations
like runtime and buildtime dependencies of a package, path and sha1sum
of the source archive, patches to be applied and other meta data informations
like packager information, description, summary, homepage of the software
project and changelog info of the package, etc. We decided to put
the data into a XML file instead of using an ad-hoc text format. This
makes it easier to process and to write independent tools for various
purposes. It is also much more structured and readable.<BR>
<BR>
Following is the pspec.xml file of joe source package as an example:

</TT></DL></DIV>
One other virtue of using XML format is that it is possible to easily
divide packages by defining more Package
tags into a pspec.xml file.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsubsection Components and Categories-->

<H4>Components and Categories</H4><!--SEC END -->

PiSi defines two relations to identify a package: Components and Categories.
We can say a x package is part of y component and that x package belongs
to z category. With components we have a ``partof'' relation and
with categories we have an ``isa'' relation.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the time the directory hierarchy of the source package also
gives us the component of the package, except for some rare corner
cases. On the other hand, category of the package is explicitly defined
in the pspec.xml file with an IsA tag. <BR>
<BR>
We can use the previous given example, joe package to show these relations.
Source package joe is under applications/editors/joe directory in
our source repository. [<A HREF="#key-88">9</A>]There we can see that the component
of the joe package is ``applications.editors''. The category of
the package is defined in the pspec.xml as ``app:console''.<BR>
<BR>
We can use the components to create a minimal system with all the
packages under those components installed. A component is an installable
entity for PiSi. You can install the ``system.base'' component
to have a minimal base system and the ``desktop.kde.base'' component
to have a minimal desktop environment.<BR>
<BR>
Currently the category info is used by Package Manager[<A HREF="#key-80">5</A>]
that has an option to show only the packages that belong to ``app:gui''
category.<BR>

<!--TOC subsection Dependency Resolver-->

<H3>Dependency Resolver</H3><!--SEC END -->

As in all advanced package systems, PiSi has its own dependency resolver.
It is designed to be within PiSi from the beginning and so different
from DPKG and RPM, not done with wrapper tools. It is based on a topological
sort algorithm.[<A HREF="#key-72">10</A>] Kept as simple as possible to be able
to work as fast and efficient as possible. It is adequate for our
needs and we do not plan to create a beast out of it. It currently
allows for the build system to provide the dependent and conflicting
packages with relative versioning informations.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Scenarios-->

<H3>Scenarios</H3><!--SEC END -->

One of the difficult parts of developing a package system is to reproduce
the reported bugs to figure out what went wrong. But it is not always
easy to reproduce the problems. Or sometimes you figure out a possible
scenario that resulted as the reported bug, but you have to make sure
that it is that case. And to make sure you fixed it, you have to have
a way to reproduce the bug easily to test your fixes. PiSi ScenarioAPI
is just for that purpose. By using the ScenarioAPI you write scenario
scripts that ends as the bugs reported. So by writing scenario scripts,
you have easily reproducable cases. You can add many packages as you
like for the test cases. The packages will automatically be created
on runtime of the script.<BR>
<BR>
ScenarioAPI uses PiSi's ability of working with a different system
root. Every command may take an optional -D parameter that points
to a destination directory that resembles a chroot system for PiSi.
The directory may be an empty one. When PiSi sees there is no database
environment in the directory, it creates one to work with. So the
scenario scripts run in an isolated space. Image creation tools also
uses this feature.<BR>
<BR>
Following is a sample scenario script taken from the PiSi trunk that
tests when the conflicting package removals happen. According to the
bug report, removal happens before any package is fetched. But it
should be done after fetching all the packages and before starting
to upgrade to the fetched packages.

<!--TOC subsection Source and Binary Repositories-->

<H3>Source and Binary Repositories</H3><!--SEC END -->

PiSi supports both source and binary repositories. <BR>
<BR>
The source packages of Pardus are developed at our svn repositories.[<A HREF="#key-73">11</A>]
The svn repositories are also used as source repositories.<BR>
<BR>
The binary packages are kept at our binary repositories. [<A HREF="#key-74">12</A>]
When new package releases are committed; the Buildfarm creates binary
packages from source repositories and moves them to the corresponding
binary repositories. Buildfarm package queue is managed manually by
repository administrators.<BR>
<BR>
The source and binary repositories are represented by their index
files named pisi-index.xml. Both created by PiSi's index command executed
from the root of the repository. The index command creates a pisi-index.xml
file out of that repository tree. Adding and using new repositories
to PiSi is as simple as:

<!--TOC subsection Building and Emerging of Packages-->

<H3>Building and Emerging of Packages</H3><!--SEC END -->

In the example above, we have added a source repository named pardus-2007-sources.
The given repository names are arbitrary.<BR>
<BR>
After adding a source repository we have many options to work with
the source packages. First of all, since we have all the source package
informations from a repository, we can simply build any package by
giving only the name of the package as in:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
#&nbsp;pisi&nbsp;build&nbsp;kiki
</TT></DL></DIV>
The build command will fetch the original source archive, the patches
provided by the source package, additional files and COMAR scripts
to a temporary location. If there are missing build dependencies to
satisfy, PiSi will try to install them. After building, the binary
kiki-x-y-z.pisi package will be created.<BR>
<BR>
The build process is divided into multiple steps. For example, you
may not want to build binary package but just to see the source
code of the software provided with that package. Or you may want to
work on that code and try multiple builds until you are finished and
then continue to other steps of the binary package creation operation.
The build command steps are: fetch, unpack, setup, build, install,
package. Fetch step just fetches the source tarball of the package.
Unpack step extracts the archive and then applies any existing patches.
Setup, build and install are the actual building steps. The last step,
package, is the one that creates the binary ''.pisi'' package. As
an example to unpack a package, you do:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
#&nbsp;pisi&nbsp;build&nbsp;--unpack&nbsp;kiki
</TT></DL></DIV>
The source packages are extracted and compiled under /var/pisi directory.
The output binary package will be written to the current working directory.<BR>
<BR>
The good thing is that you don't need a source repository to work
with the source packages. It is possible to build a package by providing
only the local path or the remote url of a spec file without having
any source repository added to PiSi database. <BR>
<BR>
Here is an example to build the same package by providing only its
remote url:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
#&nbsp;pisi&nbsp;build&nbsp;http://svn.pardus.org.tr/pardus/devel/applications/games/kiki/pspec.xml
</TT></DL></DIV>
One other feature of PiSi is its ability to emerge source packages
from the source repositories. By emerging, PiSi automatically downloads
the buildtime and runtime dependencies of the package. If they do
not exist in any binary repository, PiSi also tries to emerge those
missing dependencies from the source repositories. PiSi does not need
the whole source repository to be checked out or downloaded. Because
a source repository is represented by the index file that also contains
all the dependency informations and building a package by its remote
url is possible, for emerging a package, you only need to add the
source repository of the package to PiSi database.<BR>
<BR>
Here is an example to emerge a package:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
#&nbsp;pisi&nbsp;emerge&nbsp;kiki
</TT></DL></DIV>
<!--TOC subsection LZMA Compressed Packages-->

<H3>LZMA Compressed Packages</H3><!--SEC END -->

LZMA, short for Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm, is a data compression
algorithm. We decided to use LZMA compression in our package format
for its greater compression ratio than gzip and bzip2. It is about
%30 better than gzip and %15 better than bzip2. [<A HREF="#key-71">13</A>]<BR>
<BR>
To give a more concrete example: Pardus 1.0 stable release was using
gzip compression in PiSi packages. With all our efforts to put all
the necessary packages to satisfy the needs of a desktop user, we
were only able to put a total of 335 packages. But now in Pardus 2007,
by using LZMA compression within PiSi package format, there comes
641 packages with the installation CD. When all the packages that
are in Pardus 1.0 CD are extracted to the destination system, it takes
1.891 GB of disk space and that is 3.043 GB of disk space for Pardus
2007.<BR>
<BR>
The package format is a zip archive. This makes it possible to reach
the metadata and COMAR files of the package faster by using the standard
tools. Under the zip archive, there exists install.tar.lzma file that
contains the actual files of the package to be extracted to the system.
A sample pisi package content is as following:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
Archive:<BR>
&nbsp;/var/cache/pisi/packages/openssh-4.5_p1-13-10.pisi<BR>

<!--TOC subsection Non-Root Installations-->

<H3>Non-Root Installations</H3><!--SEC END -->

PiSi package comes with a COMAR management script manager.py that
is registered to COMAR's database when PiSi's own package is installed.
By using this script's services over COMAR, it is possible to do root
privileged package operations. Package Manager, the PiSi frontend
uses these services to install, remove, upgrade packages or add/remove
new repositories to PiSi database. The authorization is done by the
COMAR daemon. By extending these services, it will also be possible
to remotely manage the package system of any machine.<BR>
<BR>
Below is a screenshot from the PiSi frontend, Package Manager.<BR>

<!--TOC subsection i18n Support-->

<H3>i18n Support</H3><!--SEC END -->

The xml spec file format makes it possible to provide translations
of the description and summary of the packages to other languages.
We are aware of the problem that just updating a translation itself
would need a release increase and therefore a package update. i18n
support is important so we will try to balance that problem by waiting
the next release of the package with an actual update need. We are
planning to create a delta pisi package format in the future that
can also help with this problem. We decided to keep all the related
info in the corresponding packages for its ease of maintenance purposes.
Description and summary tags of the packages are exported
to a standard pot file from the repository and accommodated to our
Pardus translation statistics page.[<A HREF="#key-75">14</A>] Translated po
files then are merged with the corresponding source packages in the
repository. These operations are done with our repository translation
scripts. [<A HREF="#key-76">15</A>]<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section Near Future-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc4">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near Future</H2><!--SEC END -->

One of the important things PiSi lacks right now is package signing
and validation. We are currently working on this and expect to have
an implementation soon.<BR>
<BR>
One other feature we are going to work on is delta pisi package
format. We decided not to use a binary diff tool like xdelta. LZMA
does its job well on compression part so we are working on the
possibility of creating packages only with affected or changed
files.<BR>
<BR>
There are suboptimal usages of Berkeley DB. PiSi should have been
faster in some certain database operations. This is also planned to
be fixed in the next major release.<BR>
<BR>
A sandbox support for PiSi is also planned. There are two ways to
sandbox a build script within user context: Overriding glibc functions
with LD_PRELOAD or intercepting system calls with ptrace. We decided
to go with the ptrace, cause former makes it cumbersome to pass Python
variables between builder and build scripts. We considered Subterfugue[<A HREF="#key-77">16</A>],
but although it is extremely flexible with the Python system call
hooks, it isn't fast enough for production use in a build farm. Thus
we wrote catbox[<A HREF="#key-78">17</A>], a small sandboxing module for PiSi.
It is completely written in C, and designed to do just required
features for package management. Not all features are completed yet,
but basic sandboxing works and will be incorporated with PiSi in the
future.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section Conclusion-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc5">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</H2><!--SEC END -->

One of the design goals of PiSi was easy development and maintenance
of the packages. We think that PiSi had reached that goal in its early
releases that made us possible to create that many packages in such
a short time with so far no problems. <BR>
<BR>
Pardus tries to stand out with its new and brave approaches in the
problematic areas of Linux distributions. With PiSi and COMAR architecture
we created a system that now stands on its feet. The next step is
to evolve the system with so many things that are possible to do with
the provided infrastructure and to gain new developers by capturing
their attention with what we see in Pardus.<BR>
